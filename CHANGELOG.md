# Changelog
## Latest Commit
### BugFixes
- refactored wp.index() instances to `[]` to avoid errors in using with warp-lang>=0.11.
- Fixed bug in gaussian transformation to ensure values are not -1 or +1.
- Fixed bug in transforming link visual mesh offset when reading from urdf. 
- Fixed bug in MotionGenPlanConfig.clone() that didn't clone the state of parallel_finetune.
## Version 0.6.2
### New Features
- Added support for actuated axis to be negative (i.e., urdf joints with `<axis xyz="0 -1 0"/>` are
now natively supported).
- Improved gradient calculation to account for terminal state. Trajectory optimization can reach 
within 1mm of accuracy (median across 2600 problems at 0.017mm).
- Improved estimation of previous positions based on start velocity and acceleration. This enables 
Trajectory optimization to optimize from non-zero start velocity and accelerations.
- Added graph planner and finetuning step to joint space planning (motion_gen.plan_single_js). This
improves success and motion quality when planning to reach joint space targets.
- Added finetuning across many seeds in motion_gen, improving success rate and motion quality.
- Add urdf support to usd helper to export optimization steps as animated usd files for debugging 
motion generation. Check `examples/usd_examples.py` for an example.
- Retuned weights for IK and Trajectory optimization. This (+ other fixes) significantly improves 
pose reaching accuracy, IK accuracy improves by 100x (98th percentile < 10 micrometers) and motion 
generation median at 0.017mm (with). IK now solves most problems with 24 seeds (vs 30 seeds prev.).
Run `benchmark/ik_benchmark.py` to get the latest results.
- Added `external_asset_path` to robot configuration to help in loading urdf and meshes from an 
external directory.

### BugFixes & Misc.
- Update nvblox wrappers to work with v0.0.5 without segfaults. Significantly improves stability.
- Remove mimic joints in franka panda to maintain compatibility with Isaac Sim 2023.1.0 and 2022.2.1
- Cleanup docker scripts. Use `build_docker.sh` instead of `build_dev_docker.sh`. Added isaac sim 
development docker.
- Fixed bug in backward kinematics kernel, helped improve IK and TO pose reaching accuracy.. 
- Changed `panda_finger_joint2` from `<axis xyz="0 1 0"/>`
 to `<axis xyz="0 -1 0"/>` in `franka_panda.urdf` to match real robot urdf as cuRobo now supports
 negative axis.
- Changed benchmarking scripts to use lock joint state of [0.025,0.025] for mpinets dataset. 
- Added scaling of mesh to Mesh.get_trimesh_mesh() to help in debugging mesh world.
- Improved stability and accuracy of MPPI for MPC.
- Added NaN checking in STOMP covariance computation to account for cases when cholesky decomp 
fails.
- Added ground truth collision check validation in `benchmarks/curobo_nvblox_benchmark.py`.

### Performance Regressions
- cuRobo now generates significantly shorter paths then previous version. E.g., cuRobo obtains
2.2 seconds 98th percentile motion time on the 2600 problems (`benchmark/curobo_benchmark.py`), where
previously it was at 3 seconds (1.36x quicker motions). This was obtained by retuning the weights and
slight reformulations of trajectory optimization. These changes have led to a slight degrade in 
planning time, 20ms slower on 4090 and 40ms on ORIN MAXN. We will address this slow down in a later
release. One way to avoid this regression is to set `finetune_dt_scale=1.05` in 
`MotionGenConfig.load_from_robot_config()`.

## Version 0.6.1

- Added changes to `examples/isaac_sim` to support Isaac Sim 2023.1.0
- Added dockerfiles and notes to run cuRobo from a docker
- Minor cleanup of examples
- Added option to generate log with UsdHelper from URDF file (check `examples/usd_example.py`)
- Fix typos in robot sphere generation tutorial (thanks @cedricgoubard)

## Version 0.6.0

- First version of CuRobo.
