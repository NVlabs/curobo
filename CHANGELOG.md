# Changelog

## Latest Commit

### BugFixes & Misc.
- Fix bug in evaluator to account for dof maximum acceleration and jerk.
- Add unit test for different acceleration and jerk limits.

## Version 0.7.2

### New Features
- Significant improvements for generating slow trajectories. Added re-timing post processing to
slow down optimized trajectories. Use `MotionGenPlanConfig.time_dilation_factor<1.0` to slow down a
planned trajectory. This is more robust than setting `velocity_scale<1.0` and also allows for
changing the speed of trajectories between planning calls
- `curobo.util.logger` adds `logger_name` as an input, enabling use of logging api with other
packages.

### Changes in default behavior
- Move `CudaRobotModelState` from `curobo.cuda_robot_model.types` to
`curobo.cuda_robot_model.cuda_robot_model`
- Activation distance for bound cost in now a ratio instead of absolute value to account for very
small range of joint limits when `velocity_scale<0.1`.
- `TrajResult` is renamed to `TrajOptResult` to be consistent with other solvers.
- Order of inputs to `get_batch_interpolated_trajectory` has changed.
- `MpcSolverConfig.load_from_robot_config` uses `world_model` instead of `world_cfg` to be
consistent with other wrappers.

### BugFixes & Misc.
- Fix bug in `MotionGen.plan_batch_env` where graph planner was being set to True. This also fixes
isaac sim example `batch_motion_gen_reacher.py`.
- Add `min_dt` as a parameter to `MotionGenConfig` and `TrajOptSolverConfig` to improve readability
and allow for having smaller `interpolation_dt`.
- Add `epsilon` to `min_dt` to make sure after time scaling, joint temporal values are not exactly
at their limits.
- Remove 0.02 offset for `max_joint_vel` and `max_joint_acc` in `TrajOptSolver`
- Bound cost now scales the cost by `1/limit_range**2` when `limit_range<1.0` to be robust to small
joint limits.
- Added documentation for `curobo.util.logger`, `curobo.wrap.reacher.motion_gen`,
`curobo.wrap.reacher.mpc`, and `curobo.wrap.reacher.trajopt`.
- When interpolation buffer is smaller than required, a new buffer is created with a warning
instead of raising an exception.
- `torch.cuda.synchronize()` now only synchronizes specified cuda device with
`torch.cuda.synchronize(device=self.tensor_args.device)`
- Added python example for MPC.

## Version 0.7.1

### New Features
- Add mimic joint parsing and optimization support. Check `ur5e_robotiq_2f_140.yml`.
- Add `finetune_dt_scale` as a parameter to `MotionGenPlanConfig` to dynamically change the
time-optimal scaling on a per problem instance.
- `MotionGen.plan_single()` will now try finetuning in a for-loop, with larger and larger dt
until convergence. This also warm starts from previous failure.
- Add `high_precision` mode to `MotionGenConfig` to support `<1mm` convergence.

### Changes in default behavior
- collision_sphere_buffer now supports having offset per link. Also, collision_sphere_buffer only
applies to world collision while self_collision_buffer applies for self collision. Previously,
self_collision_buffer was added on top of collision_sphere_buffer.
- `TrajEvaluatorConfig` cannot be initialized without dof as now per-joint jerk and acceleration
limits are used. Use `TrajEvaluatorConfig.from_basic()` to initialize similar to previous behavior.
- `finetune_dt_scale` default value is 0.9 from 0.95.

### BugFixes & Misc.
- Fix bug in `WorldVoxelCollision` where `env_query_idx` was being overwritten.
- Fix bug in `WorldVoxelCollision` where parent collision types were not getting called in some
cases.
- Change voxelization dimensions to include 1 extra voxel per dim.
- Added `seed` parameter to `IKSolverConfig`.
- Added `sampler_seed` parameter `RolloutConfig`.
- Fixed bug in `links_goal_pose` where tensor could be non contiguous.
- Improved `ik_solver` success by removing gaussian projection of seed samples.
- Added flag to sample from ik seeder instead of `rollout_fn` sampler.
- Added ik startup profiler to `benchmark/curobo_python_profile.py`.
- Reduced branching in Kinematics kernels and added mimic joint computations.
- Add init_cache to WorldVoxelCollision to create cache for Mesh and Cuboid obstacles.
- `TrajEvaluator` now uses per-joint acceleration and jerk limits.
- Fixed regression in `batch_motion_gen_reacher.py` example where robot's position was not being
set correctly.
- Switched from smooth l2 to l2 for BoundCost as that gives better convergence.
- `requires_grad` is explicitly stored in a varaible before `tensor.detach()` in warp kernel calls
as this can get set to False in some instances.
- Fix dt update in `MotionGen.plan_single_js()` where dt was not reset after finetunestep, causing
joint space planner to fail often.
- Improve joint space planner success by changing smooth l2 distance cost to l2 distance. Also,
added fallback to graph planner when linear path is not possible.
- Retuned weigths for IKSolver, now 98th percentile accuracy is 10 micrometers wtih 16 seeds
(vs 24 seeds previously).
- Switch float8 precision check from `const` to macro to avoid compile errors in older nvcc, this
fixes docker build issues for isaac sim 2023.1.0.

## Version 0.7.0
### Changes in default behavior
- Increased default collision cache to 50 in RobotWorld.
- Changed `CSpaceConfig.position_limit_clip` default to 0 as previous default of 0.01 can make
default start state in examples be out of bounds.
- MotionGen uses parallel_finetune by default. To get previous motion gen behavior, pass
`warmup(parallel_finetune=False)` and `MotionGenPlanConfig(parallel_finetune=False)`.
- MotionGen loads Mesh Collision checker instead of Primitive by default.
- UR10e and UR5e now don't have a collision sphere at tool frame for world collision checking. This
sphere is only active for self collision avoidance.
- With torch>=2.0, cuRobo will use `torch.compile` instead of `torch.jit.script` to generate fused
kernels. This can take several seconds during the first run. To enable this feature, set
environment variable `export CUROBO_TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=0`.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `copy_if_not_none` to `clone_if_not_none` to be more descriptive. Now `copy_if_not_none`
will try to copy data into reference.
- Renamed `n_envs` in curobo.opt module to avoid confusion between parallel environments and
parallel problems in optimization.
- Added more inputs to pose distance kernels. Check `curobolib/geom.py`.
- Pose cost `run_vec_weight` should now be `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` instead of `[1,1,1,1,1,1]`
- ``max_distance`` is now tensor from ``float`` and is an input to collision kernels.
- Order of inputs to ``SweptSdfMeshWarpPy`` has changed.


### New Features
- Add function to disable and enable collision for specific links in KinematicsTensorConfig.
- Add goal index to reacher results to return index of goal reached when goalset planning.
- Add locked joint state update api in MotionGen class.
- Add goalset warmup padding to handle varied number of goals during goalset planning and also when
calling plan_single after warmup of goalset.
- Add new trajopt config to allow for smooth solutions at slow speeds (`velocity_scale<=0.25`).
Also add error when `velocity_scale<0.1`.
- Add experimental robot image segmentation module to enable robot removal in depth images.
- Add constrained planning mode to motion_gen.
- Use `torch.compile` to leverage better kernel fusion in place of `torch.jit.script`.
- Significantly improved collision computation for cuboids and meshes. Mesh collision checker is
now only 2x slower than cuboid (from 5x slower). Optimization convergence is also improved.
- LBFGS kernels now support ``history <= 31`` from ``history <= 15``.
- 2x faster LBFGS kernel that allocates upto 68kb of shared memory, preventing use in CUDA devices
with compute capability ``<7.0``.
- On benchmarking Dataset, Planning time is now 42ms on average from 50ms. Higher quality solutions
are also obtained. See [benchmarks](https://curobo.org/source/getting_started/4_benchmarks.html)
for more details.
- Add ``WorldCollisionVoxel``, a new collision checking implementation that uses a voxel grid
of signed distances (SDF) to compute collision avoidance metrics. Documentation coming soon, see
``benchmark/curobo_voxel_benchmark.py`` for an example.
- Add API for ESDF computation from world representations, see
``WorldCollision.get_esdf_in_bounding_box()``.
- Add partial support for isaac sim 2023.1.1. Most examples run for UR robots. `Franka Panda` is
unstable.

### BugFixes & Misc.

- Fix bug in gaussian transformation to ensure values are not -1 or +1.
- Fix bug in ik_solver loading ee_link_name from argument.

- Fixed bug in transforming link visual mesh offset when reading from urdf.
- Fixed bug in MotionGenPlanConfig.clone() that didn't clone the state of parallel_finetune.
- Increased weighting from 1.0 to 10.0 for optimized_dt in TrajEvaluator to select shorter
trajectories.
- Improved determinism by setting global seed for random in `graph_nx.py`.
- Added option to clear obstacles in WorldPrimitiveCollision.
- Raise error when reference of tensors change in MotionGen, IKSolver, and TrajOpt when cuda graph
is enabled.
- plan_single will get converted to plan_goalset when a plan_goalset was used to initialize cuda
graph.
- plan_goalset will pad for extra goals when called with less number of goal than initial creation.
- Improved API documentation for Optimizer class.
- Set `use_cuda_graph` to `True` as default from `None` in `MotionGenConfig.load_from_robot_config`
- Add batched mode to robot image segmentation, supports single robot multiple camera and batch
robot batch camera.
- Add `log_warn` import to `arm_reacher.py`
- Remove negative radius check in self collision kernel to allow for self collision checking with
spheres of negative radius.
- Added `conftest.py` to disable `torch.compile` for tests.
- Added UR5e robot with robotiq gripper (2f-140) with improved sphere model.
- Fix bug in aarch64.dockerfile where curobo was cloned to wrong path.
- Fix bug in aarch64.dockerfile where python was used instead of python3.
- Remove unused variables in kernels.
- Added ``pybind11`` as a dependency as some pytorch dockers for Jetson do not have this installed.
- Fix incorrect dimensions in ``MotionGenResult.success`` in ``MotionGen.plan_batch()`` when
trajectory optimization fails.
- Added unit tests for collision checking functions.
- Fix bug in linear interpolation which was not reading the new ``optimized_dt`` to interpolate
velocity, acceleration, and jerk.
- Remove torch.jit.script wrapper for lbfgs as it causes TorchScript error if history is different
between trajopt and finetune_trajopt.


### Known Bugs (WIP)
- `Franka Panda` robot loading from urdf in isaac sim 2023.1.1 is unstable.

## Version 0.6.2
### New Features
- Added support for actuated axis to be negative (i.e., urdf joints with `<axis xyz="0 -1 0"/>` are
now natively supported).
- Improved gradient calculation to account for terminal state. Trajectory optimization can reach
within 1mm of accuracy (median across 2600 problems at 0.017mm).
- Improved estimation of previous positions based on start velocity and acceleration. This enables
Trajectory optimization to optimize from non-zero start velocity and accelerations.
- Added graph planner and finetuning step to joint space planning (motion_gen.plan_single_js). This
improves success and motion quality when planning to reach joint space targets.
- Added finetuning across many seeds in motion_gen, improving success rate and motion quality.
- Add urdf support to usd helper to export optimization steps as animated usd files for debugging
motion generation. Check `examples/usd_examples.py` for an example.
- Retuned weights for IK and Trajectory optimization. This (+ other fixes) significantly improves
pose reaching accuracy, IK accuracy improves by 100x (98th percentile < 10 micrometers) and motion
generation median at 0.017mm (with). IK now solves most problems with 24 seeds (vs 30 seeds prev.).
Run `benchmark/ik_benchmark.py` to get the latest results.
- Added `external_asset_path` to robot configuration to help in loading urdf and meshes from an
external directory.


### BugFixes & Misc.
- Update nvblox wrappers to work with v0.0.5 without segfaults. Significantly improves stability.
- Remove mimic joints in franka panda to maintain compatibility with Isaac Sim 2023.1.0 and
2022.2.1
- Cleanup docker scripts. Use `build_docker.sh` instead of `build_dev_docker.sh`. Added isaac sim
development docker.
- Fixed bug in backward kinematics kernel, helped improve IK and TO pose reaching accuracy..
- Changed `panda_finger_joint2` from `<axis xyz="0 1 0"/>`
 to `<axis xyz="0 -1 0"/>` in `franka_panda.urdf` to match real robot urdf as cuRobo now supports
 negative axis.
- Changed benchmarking scripts to use lock joint state of [0.025,0.025] for mpinets dataset.
- Added scaling of mesh to Mesh.get_trimesh_mesh() to help in debugging mesh world.
- Improved stability and accuracy of MPPI for MPC.
- Added NaN checking in STOMP covariance computation to account for cases when cholesky decomp
fails.
- Added ground truth collision check validation in `benchmarks/curobo_nvblox_benchmark.py`.

### Performance Regressions
- cuRobo now generates significantly shorter paths then previous version. E.g., cuRobo obtains
2.2 seconds 98th percentile motion time on the 2600 problems (`benchmark/curobo_benchmark.py`),
where previously it was at 3 seconds (1.36x quicker motions). This was obtained by retuning the
weights and slight reformulations of trajectory optimization. These changes have led to a slight
degrade in planning time, 20ms slower on 4090 and 40ms on ORIN MAXN. We will address this slow down
in a later release. One way to avoid this regression is to set `finetune_dt_scale=1.05` in
`MotionGenConfig.load_from_robot_config()`.
