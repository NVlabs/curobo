*CUDA Accelerated Robot Library*

**[Documentation](https://nvlabs.github.io/curobo) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.05493)**

> [!NOTE]
> cuRoboV2 is a significant rewrite and the public API has changed from cuRobo v1.
> If you depend on the v1 API, pin to the [`v0.7.8`](https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo/tree/v0.7.8) tag.

cuRobo is a CUDA-accelerated library for robot motion generation. It provides GPU-parallel algorithms for forward/inverse kinematics, collision checking, trajectory optimization, geometric planning, and motion generation, scaling from single-arm manipulators to high-DoF humanoids.

Key capabilities:
- **Dynamics-aware trajectory optimization** with B-spline representation enforcing smoothness and torque limits
- **GPU-native ESDF perception** that generates dense signed distance fields from depth images, up to 10x faster than state-of-the-art
- **Scalable whole-body computation** including topology-aware kinematics, differentiable inverse dynamics, and map-reduce self-collision for high-DoF robots
- **Collision-free motion generation** combining IK, geometric planning, and trajectory optimization.
