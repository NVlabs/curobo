# cuRobo (For SPARROWS comparison)

*CUDA Accelerated Robot Library*

Use [Discussions](https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo/discussions) for questions on using this package.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo/issues) if you find a bug.

**Check [curobo.org](https://curobo.org) for installing and getting started with examples!**

## Installation
Run the following command to create a conda environment before running any examples:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then run the following command to activate this environment:
```
conda activate curobo-comparison-env
```

Check your python version by running the following command. curobo only works on python<=3.10
```
python3 --version
```

Install curobo by running the following command:
```
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

Test if the installation is successful by running the following command for testing:
```
python3 -m pytest .
```

## Run comparisons
You need to copy `no_filter_planning_results/` folder under `curobo/` first.

Go to `examples/` folder and run
```
python3 comparison_for_sparrows.py 
```

You can edit the `world_file` as a yaml file.
Refer to `../src/curobo/content/configs/world/simple_scenario.yml` as an example, where you only need to define a couple of boxes (cuboids).

Edit `start_state_tensor` and `goal_state_tensor` for start and goal.

The results are automatically stored in a mat file called `curobo_trajectory.mat`.
You can use a simple matlab script `visualize_trajectory.m` to plot the robot motion.

## Overview

cuRobo is a CUDA accelerated library containing a suite of robotics algorithms that run significantly faster than existing implementations leveraging parallel compute. cuRobo currently provides the following algorithms: (1) forward and inverse kinematics,
(2) collision checking between robot and world, with the world represented as Cuboids, Meshes, and Depth images, (3) numerical optimization with gradient descent, L-BFGS, and MPPI, (4) geometric planning, (5) trajectory optimization, (6) motion generation that combines inverse kinematics, geometric planning, and trajectory optimization to generate global motions within 30ms.

cuRobo performs trajectory optimization across many seeds in parallel to find a solution. cuRobo's trajectory optimization penalizes jerk and accelerations, encouraging smoother and shorter trajectories. Below we compare cuRobo's motion generation on the left to a BiRRT planner for the motion planning phases in a pick and place task.
